Changelog Introduced
    The version update panel now includes a changelog for the newer version.
Spectator UI Updated
    Now includes toggled mouse control upon pressing your +duck bind
    Added a red X that stops the replay and respawns the player (similar to MapFinished)
Bugfixes
    Fixed scroll detection
        Scrolls of all force are detected now, player should jump properly (sorry about that, scrollers!)
    Replays
        Fixed crash with replays not unloading properly
        Fixed potential crash with replays ending
        Fixed velocity setting to a value that was too high (due to teleports)

    Ending player movement actually approaches 0 now
        The player will actually stop inside the end trigger

0.4.0
Replay System
    Automatically records replays for every run
    Small, lightweight file (28 bytes / tick)
    Truncates the recording to the first two seconds before the run started to show prestrafe only
    Supports all stats that were displayed during the real run
    Allows playback of ghosts with options for 15 different display models and customizable colors (see mom_replay_* commands for more details)
Comparisons Panel
    Compare your current run against your PB
    Compare against any run stats; all, some or none
Precise Timer
    Times accurate to 6 decimal places (however, we currently only display 3 decimal places)
    The only timer for surf or bhop that is more accurate than the interval per tick
    Read about how it works on our devblog
Map Finished Screen
    Mouse controls for watching the replay of the run you just finished
    Pages for stats in every zone, not just overall
    Shows both XY and XYZ velocity (controlled by mom_speedometer_hvel currently)
Other changes
    Added Source Shader Editor
    Added both XY and XYZ velocities to run stats
    Player's velocity is now slowed down when they finish a map to allow them to see the map finished screen
    Crosshair is off by default
    left and right are now bindable from Options->Keyboard
    JUMP indicator in key press display no longer flashes when the player uses the scroll wheel to jump
    Credits can now go faster if attack is pressed
    Disabled demo interpolation, which fixes demo stuttering bug, but makes demos lag. Demos will work properly if you turn off client interpolation (cl_interp 0) but this breaks other things
    point_servercommand entities are disabled by default
    sv_gravity is development-only (sorry)
    Player FOV setting now works properly through fov_desired
    Changed mom_generate_zon_file to mom_zone_generate
